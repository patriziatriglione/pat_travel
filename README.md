#### Description
Pat Travel is a green travel site where packages are offered that try to respect the objectives of sustainable travel, offering activities, facilities and more that respect the environment, pollute little and allow you to get to know the place.

The site presents the Login and Registration page (mandatory points in the process).
Once inside we find:
- Green Package: list of green packages in which it is possible, by clicking on one of them, to read the various information and it is possible to fill in the form to book the package which will take you to the summary and payment page;
- Activities: list of activities you can do
- Local food: list of local foods
- Settings: ability to modify profile data
Additionally, the administrator profile has other sections where you can add packages, tasks, etc., as well as delete them.

#### Istructions
- At the beginning we find the login page where we can add the email and password of our account.

- If we don't have an account, just go to the registration page and fill in the various fields. Note the possibility of changing theme (light/dark)

![Register](https://github.com/patriziatriglione/pat_travel/blob/main/image_git/register.png)

- Once inside, our home looks like this and, thanks to the use of <b>Motion</b>, some elements appear as we scroll through the home.

- In green package, local foods and activities we have a list in which, only for the administrator profile, there is the button to delete them.
- Furthermore, there is a button that allows us to filter the list, showing only those of the city or country that interests us

![packageAdmin](https://github.com/patriziatriglione/pat_travel/blob/main/image_git/package.png)

- By clicking on one of the packages, we find ourselves on its page where we can read some information. Here we find the form to fill out to reserve the package.

![formPackage](https://github.com/patriziatriglione/pat_travel/blob/main/image_git/form.png)

- Once the form has been filled out, we will find ourselves on a summary page where we can read the various costs, what is included in the package and, continuing, there will be a summary of the user's data and the payment method.

- Only for the administrator profile, we have other items in the drop-down menu which include the creation of elements for the various sections.
- Here is an example of the page to create a new package
